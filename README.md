# Discord-Bot

The Discord Bot was intended for personal use but I decided to upload it to Github to share it with everybody here. 

As you can most likely tell, the bot is an interactive messaged-based bot. 

I made the bot primarily to calculate the weight of my assignments and the grade required for me to pass my courses. While I do know there are grade calculators available online, I found it tedious to have to input the weight, grade, and assignment names each time I re-opened the website, hence, the discord bot to save me the trouble. 

Since the bot replies with an embed, I can pin the message and view my grades again. And if necessary, I can copy the command, input new values, and calculate my final grade for the course. 

In the future, I do plan to add more commands to the bot for QoL and possibly change to Python. Thanks for viewing!
